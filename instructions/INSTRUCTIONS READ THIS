Hello new EricHouse user

Here are the steps to begin using the EricHouse router

1. If you do not have ruby, please install it

2. Once ruby is installed run this command in the main directory:
ruby dest.rb

This will generate or override file called 'Destination.txt'

3.Get your ip address from whatismyip.com and place it in the file
called 'peers'
Make sure not to leave any blank lines in the file

4. Start the EricRouter by doing: ruby Ericrouter.rb

5. If you followed the steps you should see your peer destination displayed
your peer will start connecting and reciving fellow peers.


Hosting a website
1. If you want to host or claim a domain you can do this

2. Figure out the domain name you want then go into the folder 'sites/'

3. Make a empty file with the name of your domain. Example: root.pong

4. Then in that file put in "website name:peer destination:port"
So it would look like: 

root.pong:-EH001-fcfe572795dbc2:1113

5. Then really you now own that domain.

6. There is not much you can do with this at the moment, but as soon as webservers
are finished you can start using your website. You can also register any domain you
would like.

When we finish this, we will be working on a system where you can send out your new website
information and if people like it, they will add it to there sites list :)
